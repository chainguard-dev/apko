# apk implementation

`apko` relies on parsing apk packages and installing them in the appropriate directories.

The implementation is in the Chainguard-provided OSS native go implementation of APK
[go-apk](https://pkg.go.dev/chainguard.dev/apko/pkg/apk).

Please see the documentation for that package.
